A Unified Multi-Objective Loss Function for Ethically Aligned Machine Learning

This repository contains the full research suite for the unified multi-objective loss function developed by Arash Yousefi (2025). The loss function enforces fairness, robustness, sparsity, and SHAP-based explainability across machine learning tasks. It is grounded in convex optimization and KKT-based constraints.
